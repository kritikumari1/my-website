            <h3>Photography</h3>
            <p>Photography allows me to create images of special events, times, and places. It lets me
                record the specifics of an event – and it also allows me to share that event with friends
                and family, long after it’s done and gone.</p>
            <p>By capturing a special moment in time, I can always remember it in crisp detail, even as my
                mental memories begin to fade. Plus, those memories will eventually become part of my
                history, perhaps even family lore. And they won’t just be passed down through stories;
                they’ll be passed down through images, too.</p>
            <p class="quote">As the saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words.”</p>

            <h3>Communication</h3>
            <p>Effective communication fosters trust with others. Your ability to listen attentively and
                embrace different points of view helps others trust that you are making optimal decisions
                for everyone in the group. As you serve as a role model, this trust will extend to your
                team and they will feel as though they can trust their teammates to fulfill their duties
                and responsibilities. </p>
            <p>The ability to communicate effectively plays a large role in resolving conflicts and
                preventing potential ones from arising. The key is to remain calm, make sure all parties
                are heard and find a solution that is ideal for everyone involved.</p>
