            <h3>Reading</h3>
            <p class="quote">“A reader lives a thousand lives before he dies . . . The man who never reads
                lives only one.” – George R.R. Martin</p>

                There are countless benefits of reading quality books as your hobby. Though we are made to
                read many books in our academic career, they can never take place, of my hobby.</p>
            <p>A book reading hobby is characterized by your intense interest in reading the quality books
                of different genres. As stated earlier, there are multiple benefits to reading quality

                experience, and understanding. As it is said:</p>
            <p class="quote">The more that you read, the more things you will know. The more that you
                learn, the more places you’ll go.” – Dr. Seuss</p>

            <h3>Music</h3>
            <p>Music has the ability to change your mood completely, depending on what you are playing or
                listening to. Music can make you feel anything ranging from happy or excited to sad or
                angry.</p>
            <p>Numerous studies done over time have shown that music has the ability to strengthen the
                heart and reduce the recovery time of patients suffering from cardiac disease. Regardless
                of genre, music releases endorphins in the brain that improves heart health. Music is also
