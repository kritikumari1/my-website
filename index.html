            <h3><u>About Me</u></h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Kriti Kumari. I am 18 years old and was born in 2003. Iam a Computer Science student pursuing
                my B.tech degree from the <a href="https://ggnindia.dronacharya.info/" target="_blank">
                Dronacharya College of Engineering</a>. I am basically from Gurugram, Harayana and passed High
                school from here only. I want to a part of enthusiastic work environment where I can grow and develop
                new skills.<p>

            <p>
                I believe that my greatest strength is the ability to solve problems quickly and efficiently. 
                I can see any given situation from multiple perspectives, which makes me uniquely qualified to 
                complete my work even under challenging conditions. That problem solving allows me to be a 
                better communicator. I am just as comfortable speaking to seniors as I am junior 
                team members.
            </p>
